# Isolation Mode: Borrowing with Precision

### What is Isolation Mode?

Isolation Mode grants you the ability to list new assets as isolated assets, each with a designated debt ceiling. This feature is specifically designed for approved stablecoins, enabling borrowers to access these assets with precision and predictability.

**Approved Stablecoins:** Isolation Mode is exclusively available for certain approved stablecoins. These stable assets have undergone a rigorous approval process to ensure their reliability and stability.

**Debt Ceiling Precision:** In Isolation Mode, each isolated asset comes with a predefined debt ceiling. The debt ceiling represents the maximum borrowing limit in USD, calculated with two decimal places of precision. This means you can borrow these assets up to the exact specified limit.
