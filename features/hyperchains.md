# HyperChains

## What are Hyperchains?

Scaling blockchains has always been a challenge. Ethereum's current throughput of 12 transactions per second isn't enough for a future where financial activities are on-chain. Various attempts like Polkadot, Cosmos, and ETH2.0 have faced issues with trust, scalability, and interoperability.

### The Trust Problem

Current bridging solutions are complex. Some use economic incentives, locking funds that could be slashed, introducing risks for dApp developers. They don't transfer real assets cross-chain, making the process expensive and less secure.

### Bridging Ecosystem Risks

Chains can hard fork, endangering the entire bridging ecosystem. Bugs in smart contracts can affect all bridges in the ecosystem, necessitating a coordinated hard fork.

### Enter Hyperchains + Hyperbridges

Hyperchains are a solution to these problems. They connect using Hyperbridges, creating a scalable ecosystem:

* Rollups have validating bridges that are trustless.
* Native bridges easily mint native tokens for transfers.
* L1 serves as a single source of truth, preventing rollup hard forks.
* A common governance framework allows coordinated hard forks.

### Hyperchain User Experience

User experience is a priority. Cross-chain wallet management and account abstractions unify wallets. Bridging is part of the protocol, minimizing costs and delays. A Uniswap transaction spans multiple chains seamlessly.

### Scalability & Data Availability

Validity proofs provide scalability—shared provers aggregate proofs, settling all on L1 in one proof. Hyperchains can exit L2 or join/exit the ecosystem. Data availability solutions ensure security.

### Hyperchain Customization

Hyperchains offer modular customization, including sequencing transactions and data availability policies. Developers can choose between centralized and decentralized sequencers, priority queues, and various data availability options.

### Privacy

Hyperchains support privacy through validium, privacy protocols, and self-hosted rollups, giving users options for their preferred level of privacy.

In summary, Hyperchains and Hyperbridges simplify blockchain scaling, offering trustless bridges, improved user experience, scalability, and customization while addressing the trust problem and enhancing privacy.
