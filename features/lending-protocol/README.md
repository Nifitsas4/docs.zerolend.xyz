# Lending Protocol

ZeroLend's core product is its decentralized non-custodial liquidity market. ZeroLend is a fork of [AAVE V3](https://aave.com/) with changes in the incentive mechanisms that make it very similar to [Radiant Capital](https://radiant.capital/).

## What is Decentralized Lending?

In the traditional world, the most common comparable to this type of transaction is a loan from the bank. Here’s an example:

1. You go to the bank for a loan of $15k
2. The bank agrees to give you $15k, however you must pay an interest rate of 10% on this loan.
3. To ensure you don’t take the money and run, you must also put up your brand new Mercedes as collateral (in the event you don’t pay back the loan, they now have ownership of your car)
4. You agree, take out the loan, and now at the maturity of your loan have to pay back the bank $15k + 10%.

The bank acts as the liquidity provider while you are the liquidity borrower.&#x20;

But what if you don’t want to or can’t go through a bank for this kind of transaction? This could be for any number of reasons, including bad credit, third-party risk, or your location in the world. That’s where ZeroLend comes in.

ZeroLend offers anonymous lending and borrowing services to anyone in the world, regardless of location, credit, or circumstance, by removing the middle person. All through crypto.&#x20;
