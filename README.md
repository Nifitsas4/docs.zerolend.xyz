# Welcome to ZeroLend

Welcome to ZeroLend, a powerful decentralized lending protocol and stablecoin native to zkSync. In this documentation, we describe ZeroLend in detail.

Welcome to ZeroLend, a space where we extend the traditional concept of lending and borrowing into the decentralized world. There are quite a few things that sets ZeroLend apart from other lending protocols in the space.&#x20;

### **1. Account Abstraction for User Convenience**

This feature allows for gas-less transactions, removing the complexity and cost barriers typically associated with blockchain transactions.&#x20;

To know more about Account Abstraction, read ["Account Abstraction"](features/account-abstraction/)

### **2. A Yield-Bearing Stablecoin**

ZeroLend has it's own stablecoin ONEZ, that is designed to capture the native yield from the lending protocol to create a yield-bearing stablecoin.&#x20;

To learn more about ONEZ, visit [docs.onez.cash](https://docs.onez.cash/).

### **3. Incorporating Real-World Assets**&#x20;

We recognize the vast potential of the trillion-dollar market of real-world assets. ZeroLend is at the forefront of integrating these assets into our lending protocol. This opens up new avenues for leveraging a wide range of assets in the digital finance realm, providing our users with unprecedented opportunities.

To know more about Real World Assets, read ["Real World Assets"](features/rwa-lending.md)

### **4. Native zkSync Project and $ZERO Token**

As a native zkSync project, ZeroLend is geared towards more efficient transactions; and potential airdrops that can benefit our users. Our governance token, $ZERO, plays a pivotal role in this ecosystem. &#x20;

To learn more ZERO read ["ZERO Overview"](zeronomics/token-overview.md) and to learn more about airdrop farming read "[Airdrop Incentives](zeronomics/airdrop-incentives/)"
