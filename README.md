## The ZeroLend Ecosystem

The ZeroLend ecosystem comprises of various entities and features:

1. **DeFi Lending (Live):** A decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol enabling users to participate as liquidity providers or borrowers within the zkSync Ecosystem.&#x20;
2. **$ONEZ - the yield-bearing Stablecoin:** ZeroLend has its own stablecoin that is designed to capture the native yield from the lending protocol and has self loan repaying capability. Users can also mint $ONEZ and participate in DeFi within the zkSync ecosystem. \
   \
   To learn more about ONEZ, visit [docs.onez.cash](https://docs.onez.cash/).
3. **ZeroLend** **Governance ($ZERO)**: A governance system for governing the ZeroLend Protocol, enabled by the $ZERO token. \
   \
