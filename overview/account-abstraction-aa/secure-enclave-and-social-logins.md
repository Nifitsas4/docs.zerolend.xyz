# Secure-enclave and social logins

ZeroLend aims to simplify user onboarding through the utilization of social logins and biometrics.

## Social Logins

The primary objective of social logins in ZeroLend is to provide a user-friendly and self-custodial authentication mechanism. By linking a user's web2 identity to their on-chain account, we aim to lower the entry barriers for newcomers. This process eliminates the need for users to interact directly with private keys, offering a seamless onboarding experience.

With social logins, end-users can effortlessly authenticate through their preferred accounts, such as email, phone number, or social media. In just two clicks, users can generate a smart contract wallet within the ZeroLend ecosystem, eliminating the requirement to download specific applications or manage seed phrases.

> We are working with Particle Network to integrate Social Login feature into our protocol. You can read more about Authentication Infra by Particle network [here](https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service).

## Biometrics

ZeroLend embraces biometric authentication, incorporating methods such as fingerprint recognition. This approach provides a secure and user-friendly means of verifying users' identities compared to traditional passwords and private keys. Users can easily authenticate transactions within the ZeroLend ecosystem using their biometric data.

> Anytime you need to sign a transaction, you’ll just have to enter your biometrics and it’s done!
