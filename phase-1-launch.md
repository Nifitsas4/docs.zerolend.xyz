# Phase 1 Launch

As part of the launch of ZeroLend, the developers are excited to share the launch of Phase 1 of ZeroLend, where we plan to launch the $ZERO token on zkSync.

During the launch phase, ZeroLend actively seeks out strategic partnerships within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The team engages with prominent DeFi projects, blockchain platforms, and liquidity providers to establish mutually beneficial collaborations. These partnerships can range from technical integrations to marketing initiatives, aimed at increasing liquidity, expanding the range of supported assets, and enhancing the overall user experience within the lending protocol.

## $ZERO Airdrop for Users:&#x20;

As part of the launch phase, ZeroLend introduces an exciting opportunity for users to receive a $ZERO token airdrop. Any user who interacts with the lending protocol during this phase, either by borrowing or lending, will be eligible to receive a predetermined amount of $ZERO tokens as a reward. This airdrop incentivizes early adoption and encourages users to explore the features and benefits of ZeroLend.

To be eligible for the airdrop you must perform any of the following activities.

* Have deposited at least 1,000$ worth of collateral into ZeroLend, OR
* Have borrowed at least 500$ worth of collateral from ZeroLend, OR
* Have deposited at least 500$ worth of LP token collaterals on ZeroLend
