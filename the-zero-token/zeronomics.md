# Zeronomics

{% hint style="info" %}
The $ZERO token is currently deployed on the Ethereum network but is available on the zkSync chain via cross-chain bridges.
{% endhint %}

**$ZERO** is a scarce ERC20 token with a maximum circulation of 100 billion tokens. The majority of **$ZERO** tokens have been allocated to support community and ecosystem-related initiatives, reflecting **$ZERO**'s commitment to being a coin governed and controlled by its community.

To achieve a high level of distribution and decentralization among token holders, the token supply will be gradually released over a 100-year period.&#x20;
