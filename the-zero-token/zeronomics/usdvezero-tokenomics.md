# $veZERO Tokenomics

In the pursuit of enhancing our decentralized lending ecosystem and community governance, ZeroLend explores the concept of veTokenomicsâ€”a model that combines utility and governance tokens for the benefit of our users.

## **Governance Token  and veTokenomics**

In line with innovative veTokenomics models, ZeroLend introduces a vote-escrow token, which would complement the utility provided by $ZERO. This governance token, would be called as $veZERO and function as an ERC-721 governance token in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT).

Much like other DeFi protocols that utilize veTokenomics such as Curve, Solidly, $veZERO would serve as the key to unlocking governance capabilities within our ecosystem. Any $ZERO holder could choose to participate in governance by vote-escrowing their tokens and receiving $veZERO in exchange.&#x20;

Additionally, users would have the flexibility to add more tokens to their $veZERO NFT at any time.

## **Vesting Period and Voting Power**

The veTokenomics model, with its vesting period, allows for flexibility in determining voting power. The duration of token lockup, known as the vote-escrowed period (hence the "ve" prefix), can vary, following a linear relationship as shown below:

* Locking 100 $ZERO tokens for 4 years would result in the acquisition of 100 $veZERO tokens.
* Locking 100 $ZERO tokens for 1 year would result in the acquisition of 25 $veZERO tokens.

In adherence to veTokenomics principles, the longer the vesting time, the higher the voting power (voting weight) and rewards the $veZERO holder would receive.&#x20;

This mechanism encourages long-term commitment and engagement within the ZeroLend community.

## **Emissions and Governance Control**

With $veZERO tokens, emissions could be strategically designed to align with the veTokenomics model.&#x20;

Users can vote and receive bribes for deciding on where $ZERO emissions got to the protocol.
