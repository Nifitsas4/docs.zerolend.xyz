# $veZERO Tokenomics

### ZeroLend's veTokenomics Model

In the pursuit of enhancing our decentralized lending ecosystem and community governance, ZeroLend explores the concept of veTokenomicsâ€”a model that combines utility and governance tokens for the benefit of our users.



### **Governance Token Possibility and veTokenomics**

In line with innovative veTokenomics models, ZeroLend envisions the possibility of introducing a governance token, which would complement the utility provided by $ZERO. This governance token, if introduced, would be known as $veZERO and function as an ERC-721 governance token in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT).

Much like other DeFi protocols that utilize veTokenomics, $veZERO would serve as the key to unlocking governance capabilities within our ecosystem. Any $ZERO holder could choose to participate in governance by vote-escrowing their tokens and receiving $veZERO in exchange. Additionally, users would have the flexibility to add more tokens to their $veZERO NFT at any time.

### **Vesting Period and Voting Power**

The veTokenomics model, with its vesting period, allows for flexibility in determining voting power. The duration of token lockup, known as the vote-escrowed period (hence the "ve" prefix), can vary, following a linear relationship as shown below:

* Locking 100 $ZERO tokens for 4 years would result in the acquisition of 100 $veZERO tokens.
* Locking 100 $ZERO tokens for 1 year would result in the acquisition of 25 $veZERO tokens.

In adherence to veTokenomics principles, the longer the vesting time, the higher the voting power (voting weight) and rewards the $veZERO holder would receive. This mechanism encourages long-term commitment and engagement within the ZeroLend community.

**Emissions and Governance Control**

In the event of introducing $veZERO governance tokens, emissions could be strategically designed to align with the veTokenomics model. A phased approach, inspired by veTokenomics, would enable controlled protocol growth and stability. These phases could include periods like "Take-off" for rapid development and "Cruise" for a gradual reduction in supply inflation.

Similar to other veToken models, the introduction of a governance voting mechanism would empower $veZERO holders to collectively decide on emission adjustments, ensuring decentralized control over the protocol's monetary policy.

### **Conclusion**

While the introduction of $veZERO tokens remains a possibility and is not yet confirmed, we are actively exploring this innovative veTokenomics model to enhance our ecosystem and community governance. Our commitment to community empowerment and innovation drives us to consider mechanisms inspired by veTokenomics as we continue to evolve ZeroLend.

We will keep our community updated on these developments and possibilities, always with the aim of providing a decentralized lending ecosystem that empowers our users.
