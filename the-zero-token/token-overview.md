# Token Overview

**$ZERO** is the governance and utility token that secures the entire protocol.

The ZeroLend Protocol strives to create open and accessible money markets for tokenized assets on a global scale. This objective was set in motion with the protocol's initial release and further advanced through the recent introduction of alternative markets.&#x20;

**$ZERO** token holders face the potential risks associated with the protocol. Stakeholders contribute in practical ways to the protocol, such as integrating it into decentralized finance platforms or providing liquidity. Both groups have certain expectations regarding the protocol's behavior, safety, and functionality.

## Utilities of $ZERO

1. **Governance:** Token holders can participate in the governance of the protocol by voting on proposals, changes, and upgrades to the platform. Their voting power is typically proportional to the number of tokens they hold, allowing them to have a say in the decision-making process.
2. **Staking:** Token holders may have the option to stake their tokens in the protocol. By doing so, they contribute to the security and stability of the platform and may be rewarded with additional tokens as an incentive for their participation.
3. **Fee Discounts:** Holding the token might provide users with discounted fees or reduced transaction costs when utilizing the platform's services, such as borrowing, lending, or other financial activities within the ecosystem.
4. **Protocol Access:** Some protocols require users to hold a certain amount of tokens to access and utilize specific features or services. Owning the token grants users the ability to interact with and benefit from the protocol's functionalities.
5. **Incentive Programs:** The protocol might establish incentive programs to encourage users to engage with the platform actively. These programs can offer token rewards or other benefits to participants who perform certain actions, such as providing liquidity, referring new users, or completing specific tasks within the ecosystem.
6. **Integration with DeFi Ecosystem:** The token could be integrated with other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, allowing users to use it as collateral, participate in yield farming, or leverage its utility within a broader range of applications and services.
