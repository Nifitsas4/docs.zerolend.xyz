# Oracles

In the context of decentralized lending protocols like ZeroLend, an oracle is essential for fetching accurate and reliable price data of digital assets and other financial instruments. By providing this external information to the blockchain, oracles enable smart contracts to make informed decisions based on real-time market conditions, such as determining collateral values and interest rates and triggering liquidation events.

ZeroLend uses two oracle providers to determine price feeds of various assets.

* Chainlink
* Pyth Network
