# How to Leverage Yield Farm

Leveraing your yield within the zkSync ecosystem is one of the major use-cases of ZeroLend. Users can deposit liquidity pool (LP) tokens or DeFi tokens and borrow stables (USDC/USDT) or ETH against these exotic tokens.

This page explains how a typical user can leverage their DeFi yield with ZeroLend. If you aren't familiar with LP tokens, we recommend reading ["What are LP tokens?".](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens)

## Depositing Liquidity and Leveraging Your Yield

#### Step 1: Accessing ZeroLend&#x20;

Visit the ZeroLend website and connect your compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the platform. Ensure that your wallet is connected to the correct Ethereum network (mainnet or testnet).

#### Step 2: Depositing Liquidity

1. Navigate to the "Liquidity Pool" section on the ZeroLend platform.
2. Choose the liquidity pool of your choice and click on the "Deposit" button. If you don't have any liquidity pool tokens, visit the various DeFi app (KyberSwap, Velocore etc..) and provide liquidity to get LP tokens.
3. Input the amount of liquidity pool tokens you want to deposit. These tokens represent your share of the total pool's assets.
4. Confirm the transaction through your connected wallet. Once confirmed, the liquidity pool tokens will be deposited into ZeroLend, and you'll start earning yield.

#### Step 3: Borrowing Assets

1. In the "Borrow" section of ZeroLend, select the desired asset you want to borrow from the available options.
2. Specify the amount of the asset you wish to borrow. Please note that the amount must be within the borrowing limit determined by the value of your deposited collateral.
3. Review the borrowing terms, including the interest rate, borrowing duration, and total amount to be repaid.
4. Confirm the transaction through your wallet. The borrowed asset will be transferred to your wallet, ready for you to use.

#### Step 4: Leveraging Your Yield

1. You can now use the borrowed asset to participate in other DeFi opportunities or investment strategies to maximize your yield. Most users redeposit the borrowed asset into the same liquidity pool they had deposited initially.
2. Always ensure you are mindful of the risks associated with leveraging borrowed assets. Use your borrowed funds wisely and consider factors like market conditions and interest rates.

Congratulations! You have successfully deposited liquidity into ZeroLend's lending pool, borrowed assets to leverage your yield, and safely managed your loans.&#x20;

Remember to stay informed about market conditions and continually monitor your positions for a successful DeFi experience on ZeroLend. Happy lending and borrowing!

## Withdrawing and Repaying Your Loan

Step 1: Repaying the Loan

3. Confirm the transaction through your connected wallet. The borrowed asset will be transferred back to ZeroLend to close the loan.

Step 2: Withdrawing Liquidity

1. Once your loan is repaid, go back to the "Liquidity Pool" section of ZeroLend.
2. Click on the "Withdraw" button next to the corresponding liquidity pool you want to withdraw from.
3. Enter the amount of liquidity pool tokens you want to withdraw.
4. Confirm the transaction through your connected wallet, and the liquidity pool tokens will be returned to your wallet.
