# Token Distribution

**$ZERO** is a scarce ERC20 token with a maximum circulation of 100 billion tokens. The majority of **$ZERO** tokens have been allocated to support community and ecosystem-related initiatives, reflecting **$ZERO**'s commitment to being a coin governed and controlled by its community.

To achieve a high level of distribution and decentralization among token holders, the token supply will be gradually released over a 100-year period.&#x20;

**Total Supply:** 100,000,000,000 $ZERO

Furthermore, the supply of $ZERO is stretched across the period of 100 years to ensure the even distribution of tokens among the holders.

## Token Generation Event (est Q1 2024)

The TGE (Token Generation Event) for $ZERO is moment when the protocol goes live. During this phase the ZERO token becomes tradable across various markets and exchanges.

During the TGE, a certain portion of the supply is relased into the market and traded. This supply is called the circulating supply of the token.

On launch it is estimated that roughly 15% of the supply will be circulating on launch. The table below showcases how much of the supply will released at the TGE.

| Category                                   | % Amount                                  | % Released at TGE | % of supply at TGE                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Private Sale                               | 30%                                       | 25%               | 7.5%                                       |
| Liquidity                                  | 10%                                       | 8%                | 0.8%                                       |
| Team                                       | 5%                                        | 0.8%              | 0.04%                                      |
| Treasury                                   | 10%                                       | 8%                | 0.8%                                       |
| Advisors                                   | 7%                                        | 25%               | 1.75%                                      |
| Airdrops                                   | 3%                                        | 33%               | 1%                                         |
| Emissions                                  | 35%                                       | 19%               | 6.8%                                       |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Total**</mark> | <mark style="color:blue;">**100%**</mark> | -                 | <mark style="color:blue;">**18.8%**</mark> |

Given that the initial FDV of the project is set at $25mn FDV and the initial circulating supply at TGE is 18.8%; This brings the **initial circulating market cap to be roughly $4.7mn.**

## Distribution over time

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-12-31 at 10.48.15 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>ZERO token's circulating supply over time. (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M-f0nKKN1_BwnSpnFm9FJ4XnscF9t968q8qwoRTUT6E/edit?usp=sharing">Link</a>)</p></figcaption></figure>

To ensure that the ZERO token's tokenomics can sustain long-term, most of the ZERO token's inflation (from liquidity, treasury, private sale etc..) will end within the first one year.&#x20;

After the one year period, the tokenomics are designed to start behaving scarcely with inflation for the emissions getting cut down by half every 12 months.

By the end of the first one year, roughly 78% of the token supply will be circulating. After which the remaining 22% gets released across an exponential decay of time.

## Detailed Month by Month Distribution

For those who'd like to take precise numbers on how much ZERO will get added into the circulation, month by month; an excel sheet (linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M-f0nKKN1\_BwnSpnFm9FJ4XnscF9t968q8qwoRTUT6E/edit?usp=sharing)) has been created, which goes into depth on how many new tokens get added into circulation.
