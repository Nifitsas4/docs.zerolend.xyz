  protocol

# Revenue Distribution

The ZERO ecosystem has two core products that generate revenue from the protocol. The [Lending Protocol](../features/lending-protocol/) and the [ONEZ stablecoin](../features/onez.md). Revenue is generated from the protocol in the following ways:

* 80% of all the interest payments collected when users borrow liquidity from the lending protocol
* A one-time fee charged (from 0.5-5%) every-time a user mints the ONEZ stablecoin.

## How is Revenue Distributed?

With the following sources of revenue, the revenue is then distributed into three different buckets. Liquidity incentives, Operational costs and the Insurance fund.

* **Liquidity Incentives:** A portion of the revenue collected will be used to either&#x20;
  * Increase the liquidity of the ZERO&#x20;
  * Incentivize borrowing within the platform
* **Insurance fund:** 10% of all the revenue collected will be kept aside in an insurance fund which will be used in a rainy day to protect the protocol in the case of any black-swan event.
* **Operational cost:** The remainder of the revenue distribution will be kept aside to pay off operational expenses. This includes:
  * **Team / Operational expenses** such as salaries, market making costs, marketing costs etc..
  * **Risk Management costs**. Payments to risk management providers who will constantly monitor the lending market. This also includes costs of conducting audits as well.
