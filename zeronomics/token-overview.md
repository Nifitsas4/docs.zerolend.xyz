# Overview

{% hint style="warning" %}
The $ZERO token is not yet live and will be made available during the TGE.
{% endhint %}

**$ZERO** is the governance and utility token that secures the entire protocol. It is used to incentivize liquidity for the entire protocol. ZERO's tokenomics are heavily inspired by the various incentive mechanisms of Curve, Aave and Radiant Capital.

## Utilities

1. **Governance:** $ZERO holders can participate in the protocol's governance by voting on proposals, changes, and upgrades to the platform. Their voting power is typically proportional to the number of tokens they hold, allowing them to have a say in the decision-making process.
2. **Staking:** $ZERO holders will have the option to stake their tokens in the protocol. By doing so, they contribute to the security and stability of the platform and may be rewarded with additional tokens as an incentive for their participation.
3. **Fees & Validator Rewards:** The $ZERO token can be used to accumulate transaction fees and earn fees from validators securing the ZeroLend [Hyperchain](../features/hyperchains.md).
4. **Incentive Programs:** The protocol will conduct various incentive programs to encourage users to engage with the platform actively. These programs can offer token rewards or other benefits to participants who perform certain actions, such as providing liquidity, referring new users, or completing specific tasks within the ecosystem.
5. **Integration with DeFi Ecosystem:** The token could be integrated with other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, allowing users to use it as collateral, participate in yield farming, or leverage its utility within a broader range of applications and services.
