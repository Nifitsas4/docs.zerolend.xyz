# Participation Incentives

Protocols are competing for liquidity by incentivizing depositors through the means of protocol tokens issuance. The ZeroLend Protocol will also incentivize its users through a scheduled distribution to benefit liquidity providers and users through delegated token distribution.&#x20;

## **Token Distribution Plan**

We have designed a distribution plan to benefit our loyal community members and support the ongoing development of our ecosystem:

{% hint style="info" %}
3% of the total supple i.e 3B tokens will be allocated to incentivize the ZeroLend users and for Ecosystem growth and development.
{% endhint %}

1. **40% to ZERO Token Holders**: A substantial 40% will be allocated to $ZERO token holders (with a preference to $ZERO stakers). This includes **earlyZERO** holders as well.
2. **40% Reserved for Future Incentives and Initiatives**:  40% will be reserved for future incentives and initiatives to continuously reward users for their active participation.
3. **20% for the Development Fund**: 20% will be allocated to the development fund.&#x20;
