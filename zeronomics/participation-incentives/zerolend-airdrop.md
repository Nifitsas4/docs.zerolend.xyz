# ZeroLend Airdrop

To incentivize growth within the ZeroLend community, a certain percentage of the supply is reserved for airdrops to the community via a points system.

The ZeroLend airdrop platform allows those who contribute to both the social media and on-chain growth of the protocol to receive a portion of the ZERO supply. This airdrop will continue to get allocated post the TGE.

Points are a simple way to measure a user's contribution to a protocol/community. This documentation outlines the mechanics of earning points, the boosts available, and how to maximize points for the leaderboard.

## How to become eligible for $ZERO?

There are primarily two ways where users can become eligible for $ZERO drops.

1. Provide liquidity to the protocol and the various products.
2. Engage with the community across socials.

There is also a third way to become eligible for the $ZERO drop, and that is by having a wallet that has interacted with various other protocols. This is a one-time eligibility which is only valid until the TGE.

**Communities and activities that are eligible for points are:**

1. Aave Users ([https://aave.com/](https://aave.com/))
   1. Users that hold or have staked AAVE.&#x20;
   2. Users that have supplied/borrowed assets from the protocol across any network
2. Compound Users ([https://compound.finance/](https://compound.finance/))
   1. Users that hold or have staked COMP.&#x20;
   2. Users that have supplied/borrowed assets from the protocol across any network
3. Liquity Users ([https://www.liquity.org/](https://www.liquity.org/))
   1. Users that hold or have staked LUSD and LQTY
   2. Users that have minted LUSD or interacted with the stability pool
4. Radiant Capital ([https://radiant.capital/](https://radiant.capital/))
